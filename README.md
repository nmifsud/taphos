# taphos

The death of a novel.

Created for [NaNoGenMo 2020](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2020). [Example output](https://github.com/nmifsud/taphos/blob/master/taphos-201126-213812.pdf) (~53,000 words).

_Taphos_ generates text using Markov models of (1) articles on the "[death of the novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_the_novel)", and (2) the [_Book of the Dead_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead), including preservation spells. However, the spells merely prolong the inevitable, as the text soon decays in stages that resemble human decomposition.

Initially, the program uses simple removal or insertion of letters and words to symbolise cellular oxygen deprivation, chemical changes and bacterial proliferation. Later, words begin to bloat and [combining characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character) suggest colonisation by flies and beetles. The skin ruptures and tissue breakdown accelerates when words themselves disintegrate (achieved by manually mangling [Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com/)'s letterforms in [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/)) and disappear. Eventually, naught but punctuation remains.

I drew the word _taphos_ (τάφος, meaning "burial") from _taphonomy_ — the study of how organisms decay. Headings were inspired by or appropriated from the [Pyramid Texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Texts). This idea more generally came about while considering [mushroom burial suits](http://coeio.com/), the Coca-Cola eggshell experiment I did as a kid, and of course, [_The Disintegration Loops_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Disintegration_Loops).
